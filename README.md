ICP1.pynb - It contains the basic codes for reverse of a string , arthimetic operations, replacement of a word in a sentence, using loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICP2.pynb -  It contains three programs 
              1)It is a program that takes two strings from the user first and last name and prints the full name and returns every other char in the full_name string.
              2)It is python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output, Finally the output is stored in 
                output.txt file.
              3)It reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
                1) Nested Interactive loop.
                2) List comprehensions

 ICP3_ques1.pynb - The file contains the following, adding more Dense layers to the existing code and check how the accuracy changes.Change the data source to Breast 
                   Cancer dataset * available in the source code folder and make required changes. Accuracy before and after normalization.

ICP3_ques2.pynb - The file contains the following, Plot one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on 
                  that single image.Plot the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object. We had used 2 hidden layers and 
                  Relu activation. Try to change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens. The same is run with and 
                  without scaling of the images and the accuracy is tested. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICP_4.pynb : Added more dense layers to the model and tested the accuracy. Ploted the accuracy and loss of the model. Took the first 9 images in the testset and 
            feeded input to the model and predicted the output.
